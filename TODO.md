Lot's to be done:

## Frontend
* experiment
    * in models list, it would be rather nice to have multi-line entries for models,
      such as having the title in the first line,
      and then another line with "description | metric,value,avg,min,max" or something
    * in models list, the metrics probably should be displayed also in a multi-line
      fashion, like having a line for the metric title,
      then the value/avg/min/max (not all, but only those set)

* general
    * date needs proper formatting
    * back button
    * modals/dialogs
        * delete button (everywhere) needs confirmation dialog
        * create/edit experiment
